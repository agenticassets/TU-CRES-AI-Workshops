## Guided Example A — Market Snapshot from a Few Data Points

### Group prompt (copy/paste)

“Given the notes below, produce a concise market snapshot with:
1) What the data suggests (and the confidence level),
2) What it does NOT prove,
3) The top 5 follow-up data points I should collect next,
4) A short ‘sanity check’ list (common errors / misreads).

Keep it conservative and avoid overconfidence. If any key information is missing, ask 3–5 clarifying questions first.”

### Optional: Example “notes” starter (for practice)

- Property type: [Residential / Multifamily / Office / Retail / Industrial]
- Submarket: [Area name]
- 3–5 comps: [sale/rent price], [date], [size], [condition], [notes]
- Demand signals: [showings, days on market, lease-up velocity, inquiries]
- Constraints: [budget, timeline, financing, target return, risk tolerance]
