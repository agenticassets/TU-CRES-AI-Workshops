## Guided Example B — Email Rewrite + Tone Control

### Group prompt (copy/paste)

“Rewrite the message below in three tones:
1) Warm and professional,
2) Firm but polite,
3) Concise and neutral.

Keep all facts exactly the same. Do not add new promises, deadlines, or legal language. Then list any statements that might create risk or confusion, and suggest a safer alternative phrasing for each.”

### Optional: Example message starter (for practice)

“Hi [Name]—Just following up. We still don’t have the documents we asked for and it’s holding up everything. Please send them ASAP so we can move forward. Also, the issue we talked about needs to be handled because it could become a problem later.”
