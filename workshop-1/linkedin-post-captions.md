### Option 1 (short + direct)

Tulsa real estate professionals — we’re excited to host **“Introduction to Using AI in Real Estate”** next week at the TU Center for Real Estate Studies. **Dr. Meagan McCollum and I** will be conducting the workshop. With the rapid rise in interest across companies, teams, and individual practitioners, we’re bringing this workshop to the Tulsa community this spring with practical, real-world examples you can apply immediately.

Over the past several years, I’ve been researching AI, using it in real work, and building AI-enabled applications—gaining deep insights into what actually drives better results.

There are powerful features and quick, easy “wins” most people aren’t using yet, and they can dramatically multiply the usefulness and quality of the outputs you get from AI.

What we’ll cover:
- AI essentials for real estate (what it is / what it isn’t) + safe use
- How to set up Projects + Custom Instructions for consistent results
- Guided practice with real-world examples you can reuse at work

**Online registration closes Monday, Feb 2.** A few days left to reserve your seat.

### Option 2 (benefit-led)

AI isn’t a buzzword anymore — it’s quickly becoming a day-to-day advantage for agents, brokers, property managers, investors, and analysts. Next week, **Dr. Meagan McCollum and I** are hosting **Workshop 1: Introduction to Using AI in Real Estate** for the Tulsa community through the TU Center for Real Estate Studies, focused on practical workflows and guided practice you can replicate in your own work.

I’ve been researching and working with AI for years, including building AI-enabled applications. (For those interested in learning more about my work in AI-powered real estate innovation, you can read more here: https://utulsa.edu/news/seagraves-leads-national-charge-in-ai-powered-real-estate-innovation/)

I’ve learned there are simple, fast things you can do—often in minutes—that most professionals aren’t doing yet. Those small changes can have an outsized impact on output quality and how helpful AI feels in day-to-day real estate work.

We’ll cover:
- Practical prompting and “how to ask” for better outputs
- Projects + Custom Instructions you can reuse with your team
- Guided examples (with templates) you can take back to the office

**Registration deadline: Monday, Feb 2 (online).** If you’ve been meaning to build real AI capability this spring, this is a great place to start.

### Option 3 (community + urgency)

We’ve heard the same thing from across Tulsa’s real estate community: “We know AI matters — we just want a clear, practical way to use it responsibly.” That’s exactly why **Dr. Meagan McCollum and I** are excited to host **Introduction to Using AI in Real Estate** next week with the TU Center for Real Estate Studies.

I’ve spent years researching AI, using it, and building applications with it. (For those interested in learning more about my work in AI-powered real estate innovation, you can read more here: https://utulsa.edu/news/seagraves-leads-national-charge-in-ai-powered-real-estate-innovation/)

The biggest takeaway is this: there are powerful capabilities and quick setup steps most people skip. When you use them, the quality and usefulness of AI support multiplies fast.

We’ll cover the essentials (and keep it practical):
- Responsible use in real estate + how to avoid common pitfalls
- Setting up Projects and Custom Instructions for repeatable workflows
- 45 minutes of guided practice with real examples and templates

**Online registration closes Monday, Feb 2.** Only a few days left to sign up.

This session is designed for real estate practitioners who want a practical foundation — and time to practice — not theory.

For those interested in learning more about my work in AI-powered real estate innovation, you can read more here: https://utulsa.edu/news/seagraves-leads-national-charge-in-ai-powered-real-estate-innovation/

In that work, I’ve found there are powerful features and quick, easy improvements most people aren’t using—yet they can significantly increase the value you get from AI and make its outputs far more useful for real estate decisions and communication.
