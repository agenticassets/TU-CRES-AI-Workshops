# TU-CRES Workshop Module
## Most Critical Rule
Focus on professional education for the **entire** real estate community (Residential & Commercial), ensuring content is inclusive, practical, and high-ROI for all practitioners.

## Naming Patterns
- `workshop-N-info.md`: Detailed registration and pricing info for each session.
- `[Title].md`: Full course outline and instructor meta-data.

## Module Boundaries
- **Content**: Owns seminar descriptions, agendas, and registration details for the Spring 2026 TU-CRES series.
- **Audience**: Mixed audience of residential agents, commercial brokers, property managers, and analysts. Avoid CRE-only jargon unless specific to a module.

## Integration Points
- Connects to the broader `AI-Education-Workshops-Trainings` repository.
- Links to external resources: [TU CRES](https://real-estate.utulsa.edu/) and instructor profiles.
