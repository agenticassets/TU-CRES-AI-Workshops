## Workshop Overview

In our final professional development offering for Spring 2026, participants learn how to turn artificial intelligence into a measurable return on investment. Driving ROI in Real Estate with AI Workflows focuses on building repeatable, efficient, and scalable processes that directly enhance profitability, reduce friction, and create long-term competitive advantage across real estate operations.

This advanced session highlights how AI-powered workflows can streamline deal sourcing, accelerate underwriting, optimize property management, and elevate marketing performance. Participants will see how to integrate AI into everyday business tasks—automating routine analysis, improving client targeting, reducing operational costs, and enabling faster, better-informed decisions. Real-world examples demonstrate how top professionals use AI to expand production capacity without adding headcount, strengthen acquisition pipelines, and enhance asset performance.

Attendees will learn how to map their own business processes, identify high-impact opportunities for AI intervention, and design workflows that produce consistent, data-backed outcomes. We also cover ROI tracking methods, implementation best practices, and strategies for integrating AI tools into team workflows and client-facing deliverables.

Leave this seminar with a set of actionable, customizable AI workflows that can transform your daily practice—and a roadmap for achieving meaningful ROI in the evolving real estate landscape.

**Note:** Attendance in earlier seminars or previous experience with integrating AI in your role as a real estate professional is encouraged, but not required.
