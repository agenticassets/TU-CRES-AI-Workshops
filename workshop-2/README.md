## Workshop Overview

Take your real estate expertise to the next level with this advanced professional development seminar designed for practitioners ready to move beyond the basics of AI. Becoming a Data-Driven Real Estate Decision Maker with AI empowers participants to integrate data analytics and AI-enhanced insights directly into their investment, valuation, and strategic planning processes. Building on foundational AI concepts, this session focuses on transforming information into action—helping real estate professionals make faster, sharper, and more confident decisions in an increasingly competitive market.

Participants will explore how to identify high-value data sources, evaluate data quality, and combine AI tools with traditional real estate knowledge to uncover patterns and opportunities that would otherwise remain hidden. Through case studies and practical demonstrations, we highlight how AI can support portfolio optimization, market forecasting, underwriting, and risk assessment across both residential and commercial sectors.

This seminar emphasizes hands-on, applicable techniques rather than technical complexity. Attendees will leave with frameworks they can immediately apply to their workflow: building simple AI-assisted dashboards, leveraging predictive analytics, and using data visualization to guide clients and stakeholders.

Join us to strengthen your analytical toolkit and become the kind of data-driven decision maker the modern real estate industry demands.
