### Training Structure

**Session Goal:**
Empower individuals and teams to integrate data analytics and AI-enhanced insights directly into their investment, valuation, and strategic planning processes, enabling faster and sharper decisions across both residential and commercial sectors.

**Agenda (120 min):**
1) **Executive context (20 min):**
   - The "Data-Driven" mindset in Real Estate: Moving beyond gut feel
   - The Data Hierarchy: Public records, MLS data, and proprietary firm data
   - AI as your Analyst: Capability to clean, structure, and interpret messy real estate data
   - Safe usage in Data Analysis:
     - Verification of sources; spotting "hallucinations" in math
     - Data privacy: processing client financial data securely

2) **Setup for performance (25 min):**
   - Data Ingestion Techniques:
     - Uploading spreadsheets (Excel/CSV) and PDFs (OMs, inspection reports)
   - Using Advanced Data Analysis tools (e.g., ChatGPT Data Analyst, Claude Artifacts)
   - Structuring the Unstructured: Converting loose client notes or emails into structured tables
   - Evaluation Mindset: "Does this trendline make sense?" (Human-in-the-loop validation)

3) **Advanced usage (30 min):**
   - **Market Analysis**: Generating hyper-local market reports from raw sales data
   - **Valuation & Underwriting**: Automating the "napkin math" to pro-forma workflow
   - **Predictive Insights**: Identifying high-probability sellers or off-market opportunities (Residential & Commercial examples)
   - **Visualizing the Story**: Asking AI to create charts, graphs, and dashboards for client presentations

4) **Guided practice & implementation (45 min):**
   - Working through real-world AI use cases together via guided examples
   - Using example documents to help set up personalized projects and custom instructions
   - Next steps for staying up‑to‑date and continuing education

**Participant prerequisites:**
- Laptop + stable Wi‑Fi on-site
- A basic account already set up on at least one LLM platform (e.g., [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) / [Claude](https://claude.ai/)). A Pro-tier subscription is *not* required for this workshop.
- **Sample datasets** (Excel/CSV export of sales comps, rent roll, or operating expenses): We will provide some examples, but it is highly beneficial to bring 2-3 of your own datasets related to a project you are currently working on where you need AI assistance.
